## Exercises

### Exercise 1

In this code chunk, we will:

- Arrange the data by the proportion of women (sharewomen) in descending order,highlighting majors with the highest proportion of women at the top.
- Select only the relevant columns: major, total (the number of people with that major),and sharewomen (the proportion of women).
- Display only the top 3 majors by using top_n(3).

```{r top_n_major}
college_recent_grads %>%
  arrange(desc(sharewomen)) %>% 
  select(major, total, sharewomen) %>%
  top_n(3)
```
