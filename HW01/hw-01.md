library(openintro)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

The data dictionary indicates that the dataset contains 52,519 pets.

``` r
total_rows <- nrow(seattlepets)
total_rows
```

    ## [1] 52519

### Exercise 2

According to the data dictionary, each pet is described by 7 variables.

``` r
total_cols <- ncol(seattlepets)
total_cols
```

    ## [1] 7

### Exercise 3

The three most popular pet names are Lucy, with a frequency of 439;
Charlie, with 387; and Luna, with 355. Additionally, there are 483 pet
names listed as unknown, represented as NA.

``` r
seattlepets %>%
  count(animal_name, sort = TRUE)
```

    ## # A tibble: 13,930 × 2
    ##    animal_name     n
    ##    <chr>       <int>
    ##  1 <NA>          483
    ##  2 Lucy          439
    ##  3 Charlie       387
    ##  4 Luna          355
    ##  5 Bella         331
    ##  6 Max           270
    ##  7 Daisy         261
    ##  8 Molly         240
    ##  9 Jack          232
    ## 10 Lily          232
    ## # ℹ 13,920 more rows

### Exercise 4

By updating the code, we identified the most common pet names for each
species. We used slice_head() to find the top names based on their
frequency.

Results:

1.  Cats: The top names are Lucy (111 occurrences), Luna (102), Lily
    (86), and Max (83).
2.  Dogs: The most common names are Lucy (337), Charlie (306), Bella
    (249), Luna (244), and Daisy (221).
3.  Goats: The name Heidi (2 occurrences) is the most common, showing
    generally low frequencies for goat names.
4.  Pigs: Each pig name appears only once, so all names are listed with
    the same frequency.

``` r
seattlepets %>%
group_by(species) %>%
count(animal_name, sort = TRUE) %>%
slice_head(n = 5)
```

    ## # A tibble: 20 × 3
    ## # Groups:   species [4]
    ##    species animal_name     n
    ##    <chr>   <chr>       <int>
    ##  1 Cat     <NA>          406
    ##  2 Cat     Luna          111
    ##  3 Cat     Lucy          102
    ##  4 Cat     Lily           86
    ##  5 Cat     Max            83
    ##  6 Dog     Lucy          337
    ##  7 Dog     Charlie       306
    ##  8 Dog     Bella         249
    ##  9 Dog     Luna          244
    ## 10 Dog     Daisy         221
    ## 11 Goat    Heidi           2
    ## 12 Goat    Abelard         1
    ## 13 Goat    Aggie           1
    ## 14 Goat    Arya            1
    ## 15 Goat    Beans           1
    ## 16 Pig     Atticus         1
    ## 17 Pig     Coconut         1
    ## 18 Pig     Darla           1
    ## 19 Pig     Millie          1
    ## 20 Pig     Othello         1

### Exercise 5

Points above the y = x line indicate that the proportion of the name
being a cat is higher than the proportion of it being a dog. Points
below the y = x line indicate that the proportion of the name being a
dog is higher than the proportion of it being a cat.

<b>So, names that are more common for cats than dogs are represented by
points above the y = x line.</b>

Some of them are: Lucy, Luna, Bella, Charlie etc.
